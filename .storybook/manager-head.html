<!--
  Story UI Manager Head Configuration

  This file injects content into the Storybook manager's <head> element.
  We use it to set the STORY_UI_EDGE_URL global that the manager addon reads.

  For production deployments (Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, etc.), this should be
  configured via environment variables at build time.
-->
<script>
  // Set the Story UI Edge URL for the manager addon
  // This value is replaced during the build process from VITE_STORY_UI_EDGE_URL env var
  window.STORY_UI_EDGE_URL = '__STORY_UI_EDGE_URL__';
</script>
